# Front End Projects

This repo contains all my front end projects for freeCodeCamp. I developed all the projects using React. I combined all of the projects together in a single page in which you can switch through them. Githug pages is the hosting service for the repo. Here are the following projects:

- **Random Quote Machine**
- **Markdown Previewer**
- **Drum Machine**
- **JavaScript Calculator**
- **Pomodoro Timer**
